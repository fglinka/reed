reed
====
A software to semi-automatically manage your local (PDF) library on console.

Reed uses metadata about literature supplied using
[BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) files to coherently name imported papers.
It also keeps track of this metadata to aid in organization. Reed is however
**NOT** a reference managment software and instead inspired by music library
managment sofware like [beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets).

I developed reed in order to assist me in organizing the papers I have to read
in the context of my Bachelor's thesis. Thus, reed is developed in an iterative
manner and **not yet functionally complete**.

Stability
---------
This software is in early development and thus there is **no guarantee** that
libraries or configuration files will stay compatible with later versions.

Feature Roadmap
---------------
This is an (incomplete) list of features I want reed to support in the long term
as well as some milestones.

[x] Importing files into the library
[x] Renaming files according to a configurable pattern
[ ] Specifying bibliographies by pasting them into a text editor 
[ ] Further documentation and a more verbose README
[ ] Querying the local library
[ ] Viewing files in the library
[ ] Removing files from the library
